# 🧠 Mental Health Chatbot  
*M.Tech Project | Artificial Intelligence & NLP*

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **AI-powered Mental Health Chatbot** designed to provide **empathetic conversational support** by detecting user emotions using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Transformer-based deep learning models**.

The chatbot analyzes user input to identify emotional states such as **sadness, anger, fear, anxiety, and neutrality**, and responds with supportive, human-like messages. It also includes **crisis detection** with appropriate safety prompts and helpline suggestions.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This chatbot is intended for academic and supportive purposes only and is **not a substitute for professional mental health care**.
